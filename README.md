# Number Sorter

## Project Overview
The **Number Sorter** is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to input a list of numbers and sort them in ascending or descending order. This project demonstrates fundamental algorithms for sorting and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with number sequences.

## Features
- Input for entering a list of numbers.
- Options to sort numbers in ascending or descending order.
- Real-time display of sorted results.
- User-friendly design for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web application's content.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing sorting algorithms and handling user interactions.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Enter a list of numbers separated by commas in the input field.
4. Choose your sorting preference (ascending or descending).
5. Click the "Sort" button to see the sorted numbers displayed.

## Example
- Input: `34, 12, 5, 67, 23`
- Output (ascending): `5, 12, 23, 34, 67`
- Output (descending): `67, 34, 23, 12, 5`

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing additional sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).
- Adding input validation for number entries.
- Enhancing the UI for a more engaging user experience.
